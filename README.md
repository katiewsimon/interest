hackNY Fall '14 project

I started this project with a partner for the hackNY fall 2014 hackathon. It is a web app that uses data visualization to demonstrate lifetime impact of current financial choices. The app is designed to be used by recent college graduates who are determining the percentage of their paycheck that will go to student loan repayment vs retirement savings. Sometimes slowing student loan repayments and increasing retirement contributions will yield higher net worth over a lifetime. 

The chart currently displayed after inputing financial data compares Roth IRA contributions according to different contribution and interest rates. It was created using chart.js.

To build on the existing project, I will add the ability for users to input additional personal data and choose different investment options. I will also change the frontend design.
